Azure Chaos Engineering Project
Welcome to the Azure Chaos Engineering repository! This project explores the resiliency and security of Azure cloud infrastructure by simulating fault scenarios, including disabling logging, exposing public storage, and opening insecure VM ports. Through these experiments, we identify vulnerabilities, analyze system behavior, and propose strategies for enhanced robustness.

Key Experiments
Storage Analytics: Simulated diagnostic logging failures in Azure Storage.
Public Storage Access: Exposed blob storage containers for risk analysis.
Open Ports: Altered NSG rules to assess network vulnerabilities.
Tools and Technologies
Azure CLI
PowerShell Runbooks
Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
KQL (Kusto Query Language)
Insights
Through automated scripts and monitoring, this project highlights critical gaps in alerting mechanisms and system recovery, driving recommendations for improved cloud resilience.
